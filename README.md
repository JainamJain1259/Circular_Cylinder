# Laminar Flow over 2D Cylinder at Reynolds Number = 100 
#### Simulation is performed using OpenFOAM v1912 and postProcessing is performed using Paraview 5.8.1
This is a part of our project titled **Flow over Rough and Engineered Surfaces** carried out under school of Mechanical Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Goa:

Simulation was carried on a machine running with Ubuntu 18.04. Serial as well as parallel modes were used.

## Overview:
#### Aim is to calculate the Drag Coefficient(Cd) and Strouhal's Number and verify them with the literature.

#### Specifications:
- Reynolds Number = 100
- Diameter of the Cylinder = 1 m
- Inlet Velocity = 1 m/s
- Kinematic Viscosity = 0.01 m2/s
